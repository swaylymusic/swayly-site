    <h2 class="section-title">Why Swayly exists</h2>
    <p class="lead">
      Swayly began with a simple idea: not every playlist has to fill the room.
      Some days, we just need music that stays close, breathes slowly and gives
      our thoughts a softer place to land.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Music that doesn’t hurry you</h2>
    <p>
      Each project is built around a few questions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Can this track keep you company without demanding attention?</li>
      <li>Does it leave enough space for your own memories and quiet thoughts?</li>
      <li>Will it still feel gentle on the hundredth listen?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Harmonies stay warm and simple, tempos remain slow, and instruments are chosen
      for their softness: upright piano, subtle brushes, muted horns, gentle bass.
      No sudden drops, no sharp edges, just a slow swing that feels like breathing.
    </p>

    <h2 class="section-title">Made for small, everyday moments</h2>
    <p>
      Swayly is for people who:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Work late at a quiet desk</li>
      <li>Read at night while the city outside turns cold</li>
      <li>Pray, journal or reflect before the day begins</li>
      <li>Run cafés, studios or workspaces that need calm, not noise</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
